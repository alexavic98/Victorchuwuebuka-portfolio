								The Discovery of Handwashing
Prior to the nineteenth century, hygiene was frowned upon. People simply didn’t understand the risk of not washing their hands. This unreasonable behavior caused many deaths, especially in hospitals where most doctors - unlike today - never washed their hands before surgeries. In the mid-1800s, the Hungarian physician, Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, decided to do something about this tragedy. He started investigating the reasons behind the deaths in Vienna general hospital and those of women giving birth in particular. After analyzing data from Clinic 1 and Clinic 2, it turned out the proportion of deaths in Clinic 1 is much higher than that in Clinic 2.
By looking further into why this happened, Dr. Semmelweis realized that many of the medical students who worked at Clinic 1 also spend a lot of time in the autopsy room as a part of their studies. So, he realized that dealing with corpses spread harmful bacteria that was transferred to the women giving birth, thus infecting them with the deadly childbed fever - the main reason for the high mortality rates.
What’s truly exciting about this project is that I will recreate the steps that someone did 200 years ago! But this time using advanced technology.
Dr. Semmelweis ordered the doctors to wash their hands in the summer of 1847. From that point onwards, the proportion of deaths decreased by around 6.7 to 10 percentage points. Truly impressive!

										Restaurant business has been seen as one of the most lucrative businesses. In this analysis, we will be examining sales data from a restaurant to understand trends, patterns, and insights that can help the business make informed decisions. factors such as the types of dishes sold, the price per dish, and the time of day that sales are highest needs to be put into consideration for this business to run efficiently. By analyzing this data, we hope to gain a better understanding of the restaurant’s customer base and identify opportunities for growth and improvement. Let’s get started!
